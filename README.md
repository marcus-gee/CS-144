# CS-144

This repository contains folders/files of projects that I have completed as part of CS 144. The projects include a web crawler, an analysis of a co-authorship graph, and an implementation of RankManiac.

The course description of CS 144 is as follows:

" Social networks, the web, and the internet are essential parts of our lives and we all depend on them every day, but do you really know what makes them work?This course studies the “big” ideas behind our networked lives. Things like, what do networks actually look like (and why do they all look the same)? How do search engines work? Why do memes spread the way they do? How does web advertising work? For all these questions and more, the course will provide a mixture of both mathematical analysis and hands-on labs. The course assumes students are comfortable with graph theory, probability, and basic programming."
